            "subheadline": "Metro Pacific Agro Ventures (MPAV), a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corp. (MPIC), announced Thursday it completed the acquisition of Franklin Baker Group of Companies for P1 billion. The acquisition will boost the Metro Pacific group’s crude coconut production capacity to more than 2 million coconuts daily, MPAV said in a statement. “Coconut is one of the Philippines most important and iconic crops—something we should be proud of,” said MPIC chairman and chief executive Manuel Pangilinan. “With Franklin Baker, we now have the opportunity to scale a globally competitive coconut platform that brings long-term processing to long-standing relationships and strong communities.” This is a unique opportunity to strengthen a flagship export sector and develop agricultural products at a global standard. Franklin Baker, one of the country’s oldest coconut processors, was founded in 1921 and operates facilities in Laguna and Davao. The company develops a wide range of value-added coconut-based products, including desiccated coconut, coconut oil and coconut cream, to more than 50 countries. Franklin Baker is an original equipment manufacturer for Axelum, in which MPAV holds a 34.76 percent stake. MPAV said the acquisition will provide Franklin Baker with the capital and strategic support needed to stabilize operations, address an export backlog and pursue long-term growth. The deal is also expected to help protect over 5,000 jobs and maintain a reliable market for more than 50,000 coconut farmers nationwide, according to MPAV. “This transaction is about growth,” said MPAV president and chief executive Joey Hernandez. “With Franklin Baker joining Axelum in our portfolio, we are building a coconut powerhouse that combines heritage, scale and global reach. Our goal is to strengthen the entire value chain—from farmer to processor to export markets—while cementing the Philippines’ leadership in the global coconut supply industry.”",

(CIC), a leading manufacturer of air conditioners, refrigerators and home appliances, reported a net income of P355.4 million in the second quarter of the year, up 15.3 percent year-on-year despite softer demand. On the close to the stock exchange, CIC said the growth was largely driven by a strong contribution from its associate, Concepcion Midea Inc. (CMI), and better sales performance from its refrigeration and appliance businesses. “While Q2 presented headwinds from softer retail demand and margins, we remained agile and focused,” said CIC chief finance and operating officer Rajan Komarasu. “Strong performance in our refrigeration and appliances helped offset challenges in other areas, reaffirming our diversified portfolio.” For the second quarter, CMI contributed P7.5 million, up 26.5 percent from the preceding unconsolidated P5.9 million. Net sales from the businesses reached P5.2 billion, down 2.5 percent during the same period a year ago. In terms of CMI, total net sales reached P3.7 billion, a 120 percent decline primarily due to weaker demand. The company expects the refrigeration equipment caused by a shorter season, as well as a shift in demand to lower-priced alternatives.",

            "subheadline": "MANILA Water Company Inc. said Thursday it will expand its Project i-Float, an innovative solution to trap solid waste in waterways, in flood-prone areas, such as Pasig, Taguig, and Navotas, after being deployed in Marikina City. Project i-Float received international recognitions for its practical approach to urban flood mitigation. Presented at the 41st International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR) World Congress and the Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) Spotlight 2023, the project showcases how simple engineering solutions can deliver meaningful impact for communities. The project was presented by Riza Olga, operations department head for wastewater facilities, and developed in collaboration with Christian Quintos and Marvin Jambres. It has received full support from Manila Water’s research and innovation arm, Manila Water Company Innovations. Manila Water’s Project i-Float uses floating bar screens to trap solid waste in waterways like Balanté Creek in Marikina City. During its pilot phase, the screens collected around 24 cubic meters of waste monthly, resulting in fewer flood incidents between August and November 2022. These bar screens prevent blockages, allowing water to flow freely and reducing the risk of flooding. Since its launch, the project has helped protect over 180,000 residents from seasonal floods and improved the performance of the Marikina North Sewage Treatment Plant by enhancing water flow and treatment efficiency, according to the company. Manila Water is also exploring the possibility of deploying the i-Float solution in other flood-prone areas within its service concession area to strengthen flood resilience and improve water quality.",
